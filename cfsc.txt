CALL FOR SHORT CONTRIBUTIONS / POSTERS

                    21st International Conference on
          Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science
                              RAMiCS 2024

              19 to 23 August 2024, Prague, Czech Republic
                  https://ramics-conf.github.io/2024/


Additionally to the standard CfP, RAMiCS is also calling for short
contributions and posters.  We are hence calling for presentations of
original, unfinished, already published, or otherwise interesting work
within the topics of the RAMiCS conferences.  The submission can be in
the form of a poster, an abstract, a paper submitted to or published
at another conference, or any other format.  Short contributions will
*not* be published in the conference proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  Submission:          14 June 2024
  Notification:        19 June 2024
  RAMiCS registration: 26 June 2024 (early bird)
                       26 July 2024 (regular)

INVITED SPEAKERS:

  Sergey Goncharov, University of Erlangen and Nürnberg, Germany
  Tomasz Kowalski, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland
  Sarah Winter, IRIF, Université Paris Cité, France

GENERAL INFORMATION:

Since 1994, the RAMICS conference series has been the main venue for
research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic
formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological
tools in computer science and beyond.

TOPICS:

We invite short submissions in the general fields of algebras relevant
to computer science and applications of such algebras. Topics include
but are not limited to:

* Theory
  - algebras such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings,
    Kleene algebras, relation algebras and quantales
  - their connections with program logics and other logics
  - their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,
    games, networks and programming languages
  - the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic,
    coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories
  - their formalisation with theorem provers

* Applications
  - tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and
    verification
  - quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing
    systems and processes
  - algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis,
    social choice, optimisation and control
  - industrial applications
