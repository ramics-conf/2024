SCOPE

Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for
research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic
formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological
tools in computer science and beyond.

Theoretical aspects include semigroups, residuated lattices, semi-
rings, Kleene algebras, relation algebras, quantales and other
algebras; their connections with program logics and other logics;
their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,
games, networks and programming languages; the development of
algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic, coalgebraic and proof-
theoretic methods for these theories; their formalisation with theorem
provers.

Applications include tools and techniques for program correctness,
specification and verification; quantitative and qualitative models
and semantics of computing systems and processes; algorithm design,
automated reasoning, network protocol analysis, social choice,
optimisation and control.

We are calling for submission of original work not published or under
review for publication elsewhere.  The proceedings will be published
as part of Springer LNCS.  As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we
intend to publish a journal special issue with revised and extended
versions of a selection of the best papers.
